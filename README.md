[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klaeufer/issue10709-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klaeufer/issue10709-scala)

[This issue](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/10709)
has been fixed as of Scala 2.12.5.

This project also includes some examples of using Mockito to express expectations declaratively.
For example, we can test whether the `Iterator.map` method is lazy in terms of
invoking `next` on the original object only when we invoke `next` on the result of `map`:

    @Test def mapIsLazyUsingSpyFrom(): Unit = {
      val it = spy(Iterator.continually("hello"))
      val result = it.map(_.length)
      verify(it, never).next()
      result.next()
      verify(it, times(1)).next()
    }
